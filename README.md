## Project: Guess the Number Game  
**Date**: April 23, 2025  
**Language**: Python

### What the Project Does  
This is a number guessing game. The user tries to guess the number the computer picked (1â€“100).

### What I Learned  
- Using `while` loops  
- Using `input()` and `if/else`  
- Using `random.randint()`

### What Was Difficult  
Validating user input was difficult, especially ensuring that the user only entered numbers and handling invalid inputs, such as non-numeric values.

### What I Want to Improve  
Add different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) where the number range and/or the number of attempts changes.  
For example, the player could have 10 attempts for easy, 7 attempts for medium, and 5 attempts for hard.

## Project: Guess the Word (Hangman)  
**Date**: April 24, 2025  
**Language**: Python

### What the Project Does  
This is a Hangman-style word guessing game.  
The computer randomly selects a word from a word list, and the user tries to guess it letter by letter before the hangman drawing is completed.

### What I Learned  
- Replacing letters in a blank list  
- Showing the user the answer when lost
- Comparing lists with `if blank_list == chosen_word`
- Using variables

### What Was Difficult  
Managing global variables was a little confusing at first.  
Also, understanding how to match and reveal correct letters in the word using `enumerate()` took some practice.

### What I Want to Improve  
- Showing what the user already guessed

## Project: RPG game  
**Date**: April 25, 2025  
**Language**: Python

### What the Project Does  
This code makes a character and that chrator is exploring the dark cave where there are lots of monsters
During the development process, I occasionally used ChatGPT as a tool to ask for suggestions and to debug certain parts of the code. All creative direction, design, and integration were entirely done by me.

### What I Learned  
- Showing the player what it can do
- Using percentage
- Using variables

### What Was Difficult  
Balancing the difficulty between early, mid, and late game enemies was challenging.
It was also tricky to manage multiple combat situations, like handling secret rooms with consecutive battles, while maintaining a smooth flow without errors.

### What I Want to Improve  
- Making the game more balenced
