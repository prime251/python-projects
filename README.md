# Project: Guess the Number Game

**Date**: April 23, 2025  
**Language**: Python

## What the Project Does
This is a number guessing game. The user tries to guess the number the computer picked (1â€“100).

## What I Learned
- Using while loops
- Using input() and if/else
- Using random.randint()

## What Was Difficult
Validating user input was difficult, especially ensuring that the user only entered numbers and handling invalid inputs, such as non-numeric values.

## What I Want to Improve
Add different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) where the number range and/or the number of attempts changes.  
For example, the player could have 10 attempts for easy, 7 attempts for medium, and 5 attempts for hard.
